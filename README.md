# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hunter

I do full-stack development using the latest and greatest technologies on the web, mobile, and in the cloud.

I also love engineering. Raspberry Pis, 3D printing, and enterprise networks are some examples of what I've worked with. 

...AND I also do all kinds of graphic design - including print design, CGI, animation, and all sorts of social media content.

When I need to give my brain a break, I like mountain biking, hiking, travel, and appreciating the Canadian outdoors. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
