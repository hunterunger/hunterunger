# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hunter Unger, Software Engineer and Operations Manager at Oxen.dev

I do full-stack development using the latest and greatest technologies on the web, mobile, and in the cloud.

Developing hardware, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, data analytics, and frondend design is what I specialize in most.

...and I also do all kinds of graphic design - including print design, CGI, animation, and UI/UX.

Any free time is spent outside. I love snowboarding, dirtbiking, hiking, travel, and appreciating the Canadian outdoors our good and sovereign Lord has gifted us. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
