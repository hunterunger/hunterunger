# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hunter Unger, Engineer and Operations Manager at Oxen.dev

I do full-stack development using the latest and greatest technologies on the web, mobile, and in the cloud.

Developing hardware, AI and Machine Learning, Big Data analytics, and frondend design is what I engineer most often!

...and I also do all kinds of graphic design - including print design, CGI, animation, and UI/UX.

When I need to give my brain a break, I like mountain biking, hiking, travel, and appreciating the Canadian outdoors. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
